The popup User Agent window should be of an appropriate size for a login-focused dialog and should not obscure the entire window that it is popping up over. touch: The Authorization Server SHOULD display the authentication and consent UI consistent with a device that leverages a touch interface. wap: The Authorization Server SHOULD display the authentication and consent UI consistent with a \"feature phone\" type display.
